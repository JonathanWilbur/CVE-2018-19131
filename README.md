# CVE-2018-19131 Demo

Work in progress. Currently, the exploit _should_ work, but I don't have it
documented, and it is relying upon the vulnerable version still being in the
Alpine Linux repo. I will be converting this to use CentOS as the base image,
so I can install from binary RPMs hosted by Squid directly.

The certificate and key included are not sensitive. They are just test data.

Pro-Tip: Don't run this on the same host that you are configured to proxy from,
because the proxy will redirect all HTTP requests back to itself.

Access the malicious site by connecting to `https://web`. Accept the first
certificate error, which is just caused from the proxy intercepting the
HTTPS traffic, then you'll be presented with the next page, which will run
the exploit.

## Exploitation

Get a victim that you know to be using a vulnerable version of Squid to click
on a link to a site hosting a malicious certificate. The certificate should
have `<script>` tags in the `issuer` or `subject` fields.
